/**
 * Holds an isomorphism relation for two graphs. It contains a mapping between
 * the two graphs.
 *
 * <p>Usage:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>use <code>getCorrespondence()</code> to get the mapped object in the
 * other graph.
 * <li>use <code>getGraph1vertexArray(), getGraph2vertexArray()</code> to see
 * the full vertex arrays order , in which the i-th vertex in the 1st array is
 * the isomorphic eqv. of the i-th in 2nd array.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * <p>It consists of two vertexes array , the i-th vertex in the 1st array is
 * the isomorphic eqv. of the i-th in 2nd array. Note that the getters are
 * unsafe (they return the array and not a copy of it).

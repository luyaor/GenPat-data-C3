 * substantial logic -- their implementation is done by their superclass. They
 * were created order to provide type-safety and in order to avoid unchecked
 * users' type-casts.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All included classes are small. They are grouped together in this container
 * to avoid clutter and to avoid unnecessary increase in configuration items.
 * If an inner class requires a more elaborated implementation it should be
 * extracted from this container to be a top-level class.

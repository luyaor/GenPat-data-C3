/**
 * A general purpose implementation of Dijkstra's method.for the solution of
 * various problems in directed and undirected weighted graphs. 
 * It is possible to solve a lot of
 * problems using Dijkstra's method and just specifying the function which
 * calculates a new "distance" from a "distance" to a previous vertex and an
 * edge weight, and whether the minimum or maximum are to be achieved.
 * For instance the shortest path problem is solved by using addition as
 * function and minimizing, the maximum capacity path (path where the
 * minimal weight (aka capacity) of the edges is maximized) is found by
 * using min as function and maximizing. A minimum spanning tree can be found
 * by using identity on the second parameter (edge weight) as function and
 * minimizing, and so on ...
